# A Really **Really** simple TO-DO app

This is a simple project intended to give me a better grasp about React Keys and Hooks.

> This is the first React app I develop. I'm doing it by myself, not following through any tutorial. Everything here is written by a somewhat trial and error. It's rather a "independecy" test than a memorization test.
